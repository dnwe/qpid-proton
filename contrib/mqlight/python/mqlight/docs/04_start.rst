mqlight.Client.start([`callback`])
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Prepares the client to send and/or receive messages from the server. As clients
are created in ``starting`` state, this method need only be called if an
instance of the client has been stopped using the ``mqlight.Client.stop``
method.

* ``callback`` - (function) (optional) callback to be notified when the client
  has either: transitioned into ``started`` state; or has entered ``stopped``
  state before it can transition into ``started`` state. The callback function
  will be invoked with a ``StoppedError`` as its argument if the client
  transitions into stopped state before it attains ``started state`` - which can
  happen as a result of calling the ``client.stop`` method.
