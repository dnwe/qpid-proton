  <p>State machine that underpins the client:<br><img src="./doc-files/sm.gif" alt="Diagram of a state machine"></p>
  <h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
  <p>The client depends on the following jar files (and has been built and tested
  using the indicated versions):</p>
  <table>
  <thead>
  <tr>
  <th>Dependency</th>
  <th>Version  </th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
  <td>Google Gson</td>
  <td>2.2.4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Logback Classic</td>
  <td>1.1.2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Logback Core</td>
  <td>1.1.2</td>

  <td>Apache Netty</td>
  <td>4.0.21.Final</td>

  <td>Stateless4J</td>
  <td>2.5.0</td>

  </table>
  <p>The client can be installed into a Maven repository and automatically resolve these dependencies. For example:</p>
  <pre><code>mvn org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-install-plugin:2.5.2:install-file -Dfile=mqlight-api-$version.jar
  mvn dependency:get -Dartifact=com.ibm.mqlight.api:mqlight-api:$version
  </code></pre><p>The client includes &#39;maven_install.sh&#39; (for Linux) and &#39;maven_install.cmd&#39; (for Windows) scripts to perform the
  above maven install step, and additionally installs the samples.</p>
  <h2 id="plug-points-for-extending-the-client">Plug-points for extending the client</h2>
  <p>The client implements a number of its components in such a way as they can be
  replaced by alternative implementations.</p>
  <p>The following table describes the various plug-points provided by the client.
  For more information about an individual plug-point, please consult the
  Javadoc for the relevant interface.</p>
  <table>
  <thead>
  <tr>
  <th>Interface</th>
  <th>Description</th>
  <th>Supplied implementations</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
  <td>com.ibm.mqlight.api.callback.CallbackService</td>
  <td>A plug point for the code that is run each time the client needs to call back into application code.</td>
  <td>The client supplies two implementations. The first is: com.ibm.mqlight.api.callback.impl.SameThreadCallbackService, which calls back into application code using whatever thread calls in to the plug-point. This introduces minimal overhead on running callbacks - but is not suitable for callbacks that block. The second implementation is: com.ibm.mqlight.api.callback.impl.ThreadPoolCallbackService which schedules callbacks into a threadpool. The default is com.ibm.mqlight.api.callback.impl.ThreadPoolCallbackService.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>com.ibm.mqlight.api.endpoint.EndpointService</td>
  <td>A plug point for determining the location of the MQ Light server (or service) to connect to.</td>
  <td>The client supplies two implementations, which can be chosen between depending on the value of the <code>service</code> parameter passed into the <code>create</code> method used to create the client. The first implementation is: com.ibm.mqlight.api.impl.endpoint.SingleEndpointService, which always returns the same endpoint details and is useful when connecting to the stand-alone MQ Light server. The second implementation is: com.ibm.mqlight.api.impl.endpoint.BluemixEndpointService, which (as the name suggests) looks up instances of the MQ Light service in the Bluemix environment.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>com.ibm.mqlight.api.network.NetworkService</td>
  <td>A plug point for interfacing with the network used between the MQ Light client and server.</td>
  <td>The client supplies an Apache Netty-based implementation: com.ibm.mqlight.api.impl.network.NettyNetworkService</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>com.ibm.mqlight.api.timer</td>
  <td>A plug point for scheduling work to be done at some point in the future. The client uses this to implement inactivity timeouts for the AMQP protocol, and also a delay between repeated attempts to establish connectivity to the MQ Light server.</td>
  <td>The client supplies an implementation based on ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor: com.ibm.mqlight.api.impl.timer.TimerServiceImpl</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>
  <h2 id="some-notes-on-logging">Some notes on logging</h2>
  <p>The client logs using the SLF4J interfaces. If it is used in a runtime where
  an implementation of SLF4J has already been started, then it will use this for
  logging. If it is used in a runtime where Logback is used to implement SLF4J
  and the LogManager has not been started then it will configure Logback itself.
  Currently this involves enabling WARN and above logging unless the
  MQLIGHT_JAVA_LOG environment variable is set (to any value) in which case
  DEBUG and above logging is enabled using Logback&#39;s BasicConfigurator.</p>
  <h2 id="current-limitations">Current limitations</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>No support for dispatching application callbacks into a pool of threads.
  Callbacks are run on whatever thread needs to call back into application
  code - which is not a good fit for some workloads.</li>
  </ul>
